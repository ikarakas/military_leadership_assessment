# Military Leadership Assessment Application v2.0

This Python-based command-line application uses machine learning to assess and predict leadership competencies for military officers.

## Features

* Locally hosted and run.
* Utilizes open-source AI/ML libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy).
* Trains a model on a dataset of military officers (OF-2 to OF-6).
* Predicts `leadership_competency_summary` (strategic_thinking, communication, team_leadership, execution, adaptability) for a given officer.
* Supports generation of synthetic training data.
* Verbose logging for operational transparency.

## Machine Learning Architecture

### Model Architecture
* **Base Model**: Random Forest Regressor (100 trees)
* **Multi-Output Regression**: Uses scikit-learn's MultiOutputRegressor to predict multiple leadership competencies simultaneously
* **Feature Engineering Pipeline**:
  * Numerical Features: Standardization using StandardScaler
  * Categorical Features: One-Hot Encoding with unknown category handling
  * Missing Value Handling: Median imputation for numerical features, constant imputation for categorical features

### Feature Groups
1. **Numerical Features**:
   * Rank index, age, years of service
   * Combat deployments, medals and commendations
   * Unit readiness score, promotion potential score

2. **Competency Features** (21 dimensions):
   * Strategic thinking, language skills, ethical reasoning
   * Trust building, collaboration, consensus building
   * Technology integration and understanding
   * Change management capabilities
   * Leadership and relationship skills
   * Adaptability and resilience metrics

3. **Competency Domain Features**:
   * Cognitive, social, technological
   * Transformative, personal, professional

4. **Psychometric Features**:
   * Big Five personality traits (conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness)

5. **Categorical Features**:
   * Branch, rank, specialty
   * Education, leadership style

### Training Process
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   * Feature extraction and flattening of nested JSON structures
   * Train-test split (80-20) after preprocessing
   * Comprehensive feature scaling and encoding

2. **Model Training**:
   * Multi-output regression approach
   * Parallel training of multiple Random Forest models
   * Automatic feature importance analysis
   * Performance visualization generation

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   * Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   * R-squared (RÂ²) score
   * Per-competency performance tracking

## Security Considerations

* **Data Privacy**:
  * All processing is done locally
  * No data transmission to external servers
  * Synthetic data generation for training purposes

* **Model Security**:
  * Model and preprocessor serialization using joblib
  * Secure storage of trained models
  * Input validation and sanitization

* **Access Control**:
  * Command-line interface with controlled access
  * Logging of all operations for audit trails
  * Error handling and validation at all stages

Note: The versions shown are minimum required versions. The application will work with newer versions of these packages.

## Command Line Options

The application provides three main commands: `train`, `predict`, and `generate-synthetic-data`. Each command has its own set of options.

### Global Options

All commands support the following global option:
- `--log-level {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}`: Set the logging level (default: INFO)

### Train Command

Trains a new leadership assessment model using provided training data.

```bash
python src/main.py train [options]
```

Options:
- `--data-path PATH`: Path to the training data file in JSONL format (required)
- `--model-output-path PATH`: Path to save the trained model (default: models/leadership_model.joblib)
- `--preprocessor-output-path PATH`: Path to save the fitted preprocessor (default: models/preprocessor.joblib)

Example:
```bash
# Train with default model and preprocessor paths
python src/main.py --log-level DEBUG train --data-path data/synthetic_data/generated_1000.jsonl

# Train with custom output paths
python src/main.py --log-level DEBUG train \
    --data-path data/synthetic_data/generated_1000.jsonl \
    --model-output-path models/custom_model.joblib \
    --preprocessor-output-path models/custom_preprocessor.joblib
```

### Predict Command

Predicts leadership competencies for a new officer using a trained model.

```bash
python src/main.py predict [options]
```

Options:
- `--officer-data PATH`: Path to the JSON file containing the officer's data for prediction (required)
- `--model-path PATH`: Path to the trained model file (default: models/leadership_model.joblib)
- `--preprocessor-path PATH`: Path to the fitted preprocessor file (default: models/preprocessor.joblib)

Example:
```bash
# Predict using default model and preprocessor
python src/main.py --log-level DEBUG predict --officer-data data/new_officer.json

# Predict using custom model and preprocessor
python src/main.py --log-level DEBUG predict \
    --officer-data data/new_officer.json \
    --model-path models/custom_model.joblib \
    --preprocessor-path models/custom_preprocessor.joblib
```

### Generate Synthetic Data Command

Generates synthetic officer data for training purposes.

```bash
python src/main.py generate-synthetic-data [options]
```

Options:
- `--output-path PATH`: Path to save the generated synthetic data in JSONL format (required)
- `--num-officers N`: Number of synthetic officer profiles to generate (default: 100)

Example:
```bash
# Generate 100 synthetic officers (default)
python src/main.py --log-level DEBUG generate-synthetic-data --output-path data/synthetic_data/generated.jsonl

# Generate 500 synthetic officers
python src/main.py --log-level DEBUG generate-synthetic-data \
    --output-path data/synthetic_data/generated.jsonl \
    --num-officers 500
```

## Summary - Recommended Running Sequence for the new starters

1.  Generate data for model training/learning. 
* You can **choose to** generate synthetic data first.  (The app ships with few generated_ named synthetic leadership data which is used for learning, though)  

*  If you want to generate data, here's an example that generates 2,500 (two thousand five hundred) of leader data: 

   ```python
   # generate data 
   python src/main.py --log-level DEBUG generate-synthetic-data  --output-path data/synthetic_data/generated_2500.jsonl --num-officers 2500 
   ``` 

2. Train the model 

* Here's how you train the model : 

   ```python
   #train 
   python src/main.py train --data-path data/synthetic_data/generated_2500.jsonl --model-output-path models/leadership_model.joblib
   ```

* In addition to model training, this step also generates a bunch of ".png" files under "visualizations" folder 

3. Predict a (new) leader's 5 leadership competencies 

* Here's an example: 

   ```python
   #predict 
   python src/main.py predict --officer-data data/new_officer.json --model-path models/leadership_model.joblib
   ```

* The model-path is the model-output-path from the previous step
* In addition to prediction, this step also generates a single ".png" file belonging to the leader being predicted - where you can visually see the predicted values generated by the application.
